					<h1>Intro to Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What is an ORM?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Bidirectionally maps data between relational database records and objects in an object-oriented language
						</li>
						<li><em>NOT</em> a replacement for SQL or thinking about SQL</li>
						<li>
							Allows idiomatic object-oriented programming
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The first bullet is more or less the mechanical stuff an ORM will do.</p>
						<p>
							ORMs are a leaky abstraction of SQL. Generally, its considered bad
							that you still have to think about underlying details of the abstraction.
							In this case, day-to-day, you use composed objects as normal in an 
							object-oriented language, but when you need to, or it's advantageous,
							you can fall back on SQL. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Idiomatic coding is really the whole key to why we would use an ORM.
							It makes working in an object-oriented language much more natural.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Entity</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>A composable Object that <em>usually</em> represents a table</li>
						<li>Composed entities make a traversable model of stored state</li>
						<li>
							Unit of persistence
							<ul>
								<li>The ORM manages the creation of SQL statements under the hood</li>
								<li>The ORM will also manage the <em>timing</em> of the queries, optimizing for performance</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							I say usually, because entities can represent views, 
							or a custom query that's convenient to work with.
						</p>
						<p>
							By composition, I mean that just as SQL tables can be composed via relationships,
							entities can be composed just like any other object to represent those relationships.
						</p>
						<p>
							Often, you will hear an entity referred to as a unit of persistence.
							This means that when adding data to the database, it will be done 
							via the defined entities.
						</p>

					<h2>ORMs in regular use in 2025</h2>
					<h3>Jakarta Persistence API (JPA)</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Hibernate</li>
						<li>EclipseLink</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Python</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>SQL Alchemy</li>
						<li>Django Models</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>.NET</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Microsoft Entity Framework</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						These are some ORMs you may have run across, but this is nowhere near a comprehensive list.
						I'm going to focus on Java <em>JPA</em> libraries because these are what I have the most experience with, 
						but there definitely are other notable ORM or ORM-adjacent libraries like JOOQ. I just don't know very much about it.

						<p>
							Mapping records to "Entity" objects &mdash; It's pretty much what it says on the tin. The ORM handles all the messy
							work that converts between database native data types and the programming language's native data types,
							and data is organized within instance objects as data is gathered.
							Much of that just happens automatically, but there are a bunch of mechanisms to do custom conversions between types.
							The main point here is to make it very easy to create data objects easily without having to build and maintain
							every conversion. Anybody who's worked with a JDBC ResultSet will know that it's doable in plain JDBC, but it sure is a pain.
						</p>
						<p>
							Rather than leaning heavily on table joins as is common in SQL, Entites may have relationships defined between 
							them, and the ORM will take care of either making the join during the first object's querying, or 
							making a subsequent query if the related object is accessed through a getter.
							The idea here is to make a much more reusable data model rather than making multiple bespoke SQL queries that
							won't be as reusable.

							This to me is the other really big feature of an ORM.

						<p>
							Rather than having to deal with explicit joins and deal with the returned data manually,
							using ORM relationships allows for a much more idiomatic getters on entity objects.
						</p>

							However, relationships definitely need to be approached with some healthy caution.

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The crux of a relationship is the @JoinColumn(s) annotation(s)
							from the side of the relationship in SQL would have a foreign key.
							For example, an OpgsVisit has packageName and baseline fields that
							act as a compound foreign key to an OpgsPackage.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the OpgsPackage side of the relationship, mappedBy tells OpgsPackage which field
							in OpgsVisit to refer to for its relationship. The cascade property tells OpgsPackage
							how to handle changes to its state and how to handle persistence of related objects.
							For example, CascadeType.PERSIST means that OpgsVisit objects added to the 
							opgsVisits List should be persisted along with the OpgsPackage itself.
						</p>
						<p>
							The @OrderBy annotation works pretty much like an ORDER BY clause in a SQL SELECT 
							statement. When querying for OpgsPackages, the related OpgsVisit objects will be ordered 
							by the onboard visit order automatically. There's a sneaky little pitfall here, though.
							If you create a new OpgsPackage, and start adding visits to that ArrayList, they will
							<em>appear in the order they were added, and won't be sorted by onboard visit order!</em>.
							In reality, the field type is a List, not an ArrayList, and ArrayList is only used as
							a default list when newing up an OpgsPackage. Hibernate will give you another object that
							implements the List interface. (It's a PersistentBag.)

						<p>
							Persisting data is where we really need to start shifting our thinking from queries to relationships,
							and how the ORM manages queries in the first place.
						</p>
						<p>
							We know that eventually, an INSERT query needs to be sent to the database for each new record we're creating,
							but how that happens is not necessarily obvious in object-oriented code.
						</p>
						<p>
							This starts out straightforward enough. New up a OpgsPackage.
							Then use the EntityManager to persist() the package.
							When thinking in queries, persist() seems like it would be analogous to an INSERT
						</p>
						<p>
							But where are the INSERT statements for the related OpgsVisit objects?
							There's no call to persist() for them!
						</p>
						<p>
							What really happens when you use persist() is that the ORM takes that as an instruction
							to eventually insert that object's data into the database, but it doesn't happen until 
							either a subsequent query needs that data, or the transaction is committed. 
						</p>
						<p>
							For the OpgsVisit objects, since we marked the relationship as Cascade.PERSIST,
							the ORM will automatically create the INSERT statements for them under the hood.
							All you have to do is add them to the OpgsPackage.opgsVisits List.
						</p>
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h2>Flushing</h2>
					<p>The ORM waits as long as possible before doing data mutation queries</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If the transaction wrapping the persistence session is committed.</li>
						<li>If the ORM decides that a subsequent query that needs a 
							previous insert/update/delete to make sense in the new query.</li>
						<li>If the persistence session is flushed explicity.</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>This seems like a good time to talk a bit about <em>flushing</em>.</p>
						<p>
							For performance reasons, the ORM tries to minimize the number of round trips to the
							database server, since a network connection is always going to be the slowest way to
							transfer data.
						</p>
						<p>
							For example, if you use several different setters on an entity, you don't want
							a round trip to the server for each one. Depending on how you're populating your entity, 
							that might result in an error because a column that's not null would be null since you
							haven't set that field in the entity yet.
						</p>
						<p>
							Until the persistence session is flushed, no data changes are present on the server.
						</p>
						<p>This is why all mutation queries <em>must</em> be part of a transaction.</p>
						<p>
							Generally, it's best let the ORM decide when to write to the database. 
							This lets the ORM collect changes to the entity/object and only write the last change, 
							preventing a bunch of unneeded queries.
						</p>
						<p>
							One example of a reason to manually flush is if you have a chicken/egg situation where 
							database data is running parallel to filesystem data, and both need to be consistent.
							You can flush before writing to the filesystem, keeping the transaction open.
							If the database write succeeds, but the filesystem write fails, you can still throw
							an exception and rollback the transaction.

					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Relationship Pitfalls &mdash; The n + 1 problem</h2>
					<p>
						Performance suffers when one or more queries are performed for each object in a list.
					</p>
					<h3>Example</h3>
					<p>
						Working from a list of exposures
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape class="language-sql">
								SELECT * FROM exposures
								WHERE program = 12345 AND observation = 1 AND visit = 1;
							</code>
						</pre>
					</p>
					<p>
						And then getting exposure specification for each exposure 
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape class="language-sql">
								SELECT * from miri_exposure_specification
								WHERE program = 12345 AND observation = 1 AND visit = 1
									AND order_number = @exposure_specification_order_number ;
							</code>
						</pre>
					</p>
					<p>
						Resulting in a performance problem due to all the overhead of setting up 
						and tearing down a query, and sending that query over the network.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The obvious answer here is to use joins, whether traditional SQL or object-oriented. 
							Which brings us to...</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Relationship pitfalls &mdash; Where Joins are problematic</h2>
					<p>
						Using a join to solve the n + 1 problem
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape class="language-sql">
								SELECT e.*, mes.* FROM miri_exposure_specification mes 
									LEFT JOIN exposures e 
										ON mes.program = e.program AND ...
							</code>
						</pre>
					</p>
					<p>But what happens if there are multiple joins?</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							If <em>many</em> miri_exposure_specification per exposure, the result set will include 
							duplicate data for each exposure that has multiple miri_exposure_specification records.
						</p>
						<p>
							This isn't particularly a problem if there's only one one-to-many relationship.
						</p>
						<p>
							But if there are two or more joins, you have duplicated data for both the primary table,
							and duplicated data for each join for each record in each join.
							
						</p>
						<p>So what's ideal? Unfortunately, there's no single answer - it depends on the data.</p>

					<h2>Auto DDL Generation</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Use with caution in production</li>
						<li>Very useful for integration tests</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Auto DDL essentially builds a set of DDL create statements based on the entity model.
							It creates a bunch of tables in an empty database automatically.
						</p>
						<p>
							Generally, it's frowned upon to use Hibernate auto-ddl in production.
							Database-specific features can sometimes be supported, but it gets wonky.
						</p>
						<p>
							For fresh databases such as in an isolated integration test in a throwaway database, it's extremely handy.
							Database tables are automatically created to match the defined entities, including keys, field types, constraints, foreign keys, etc.
							Additional raw SQL to be run at startup can be specified, or raw SQL mutation queries can, as always, still be run.
						</p>

							Maven/JUnit definition of Integration Test. Other definitions exist.

					<h2>Conclusions &mdash; When would one use or not use an ORM?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Great for projects big enough to have a lot of very similar queries</li>
						<li>Massive overkill for small, simple projects with few queries</li>
						<li>The team is still learning to use SQL? Don't use an ORM.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Conclusions &mdash; Other random thoughts</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>ORMs really help with code readability and consistency</li>
						<li>Code for readability first, then work out performance tweaks based on real-world timing data</li>
						<li>Make use of debug logs when trying to figure out what the ORM thinks it's doing</li>
						<li>ORMs 👏 are 👏 not 👏 substitutes 👏 for 👏 knowing 👏 SQL</li>
