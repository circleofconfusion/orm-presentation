					<h1>Intro to Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What is an ORM?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Bidirectionally convert data between relational database records and objects in an object-oriented language.
						</li>
						<li>
							Allows idiomatic object-oriented programming.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						The first bullet is more or less the mechanical stuff an ORM will do.
						The second bullet is really the whole key to why we would use an ORM.
						It makes working in an object-oriented language much more natural.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>ORMs in regular use in 2025</h2>
					<h3>Java/Jakarta Persistence API (JPA)</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Hibernate</li>
						<li>EclipseLink</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Python</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>SQL Alchemy</li>
						<li>Django Models</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>.NET</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Microsoft Entity Framework</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						These are some ORMs you may have run across, but this is nowhere near a comprehensive list.
						I'm calling out Java <em>JPA</em> libraries specifically because these are what I have the most experience with, 
						but there definitely are other notable ORM or ORM-adjacent libraries like JOOQ. I just don't know very much about it.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Common Features</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Map records to Objects</li>
						<li>Relate Objects to other Objects</li>
						<li>Most have a specific query language</li>
						<li>Criteria queries</li>
						<li>Always able to write raw SQL queries</li>
						<li>Optimize queries automatically</li>
						<li>Auto DDL generation</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Mapping records to "Entity" objects &mdash; It's pretty much what it says on the tin. The ORM handles all the messy
							work that converts between database native data types and the programming language's native data types,
							and data is organized within instance objects as data is gathered.
							Much of that just happens automatically, but there are a bunch of mechanisms to do custom conversions between types.
							The main point here is to make it very easy to create data objects easily without having to build and maintain
							every conversion. Anybody who's worked with a JDBC ResultSet will know that it's doable in plain JDBC, but it sure is a pain.
						</p>
						<p>
							Rather than leaning heavily on table joins as is common in SQL, Entites may have relationships defined between 
							them, and the ORM will take care of either making the join during the first object's querying, or 
							making a subsequent query if the related object is accessed through a getter.
							The idea here is to make a much more reusable data model rather than making multiple bespoke SQL queries that
							won't be as reusable.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Mapping records to Objects</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Relating Objects to other Objects</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Query languages</h2>
					<h3>Examples</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) for Hibernate and EclipseLink</li>
						<li>Language-INtegrated Query (LINQ) for .NET</li>
						<li></li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Query optimization: Flushing</h2>
					<p>
						Flushing means updating the database to match what's in memory.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Done automatically with the close of a transaction.</li>
						<li>ORM will also flush some objects if new queries would depend on the object's updates</li>
						<li>May be done at any time - but don't do that without a very good reason.</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Generally, it's best let the ORM decide when to write to the database. 
							This lets the ORM collect changes to the entity/object and only write the last change, 
							preventing a bunch of unneeded queries.
						</p>
						<p>
							One example of a reason to manually flush is if you have a chicken/egg situation where 
							database data is running parallel to filesystem data, and both need to be consistent.
							You can flush before writing to the filesystem, keeping the transaction open.
							If the database write succeeds, but the filesystem write fails, you can still throw
							an exception and rollback the transaction.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Auto DDL Generation</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Use with caution in production</li>
						<li>Very useful for integration tests</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Generally, it's frowned upon to use Hibernate auto-ddl in production, because the results can get unpredictable.
							Database-specific features won't be supported. Standard SQL only. (What's the specific spec?)
						</p>
						<p>
							For fresh databases such as in an isolated integration test in a throwaway database, it's extremely handy.
							Database tables are automatically created to match the defined entities, including keys, field types, constraints, foreign keys, etc.
							Additional raw SQL to be run at startup can be specified, or raw SQL mutation queries can, as always, still be run.
						</p>
						<p>
							Maven/JUnit definition of Integration Test. Other definitions exist.
						</p>

				<section>
					<h2>Relationship Pitfalls: The n + 1 problem</h2>
					<p>
						Performance suffers when one or more queries are performed for each object in a list.
					</p>
					<h3>Example</h3>
					<p>
						Working from a list of exposures
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape>
								SELECT * FROM exposures
								WHERE program = 12345 AND observation = 1 AND visit = 1;
							</code>
						</pre>
					</p>
					<p>
						And then getting exposure specification for each exposure 
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape>
								SELECT * from miri_exposure_specification
								WHERE program = 12345 AND observation = 1 AND visit = 1
									AND order_number = @exposure_specification_order_number ;
							</code>
						</pre>
					</p>
					<p>
						Resulting in a performance problem due to all the overhead of setting up 
						and tearing down a query, and sending that query over the network.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The obvious answer here is to use joins, which brings us to...</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Relationship pitfalls: Where Joins are problematic</h2>
					<p>
						Using a join to solve the n + 1 problem
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape>
								SELECT e.*, mes.* FROM exposures e 
									LEFT JOIN miri_exposure_specification 
										ON mes.program = e.program AND ...
							</code>
						</pre>
					</p>
					<p>
						OK if only a few miri_exposure_specification records per exposure.
					</p>
					<p>
						If <em>many</em> miri_exposure_specification per exposure, the result set will include 
						duplicate data for each exposure that has multiple miri_exposure_specification records.
					</p>
					<p>
						The size of the data transfer over the network can quickly become worse than the problems
						caused by the n + 1 approach.
					</p>
					<p>
						Worse, if you have two joins, you have duplicated data for both the primary table,
						and duplicated data for each join for each record in each join.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Unfortunately, there's no single answer - it depends on the data.</p>
						<p>So far, we've only talked about SQL. So how does this work in an ORM?</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

					<h2>Relationship pitfalls: Lazy vs. Eager loading</h2>
					<h3>Lazy loading</h3>
					<p>
						Runs a separate SQL query only when a getter is used to access a list of related objects. Best when
						<ul>
							<li>Lists of related objects could be large</li>
							<li>When the relationship isn't always used.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h3>Eager loading</h3>
					<p>
						Creates a join query such that related objects are included in the parent query. Best when
						<ul>
							<li>Related objects will always be needed</li>
							<li>Number of related objects per record is small</li>
							<li>Only a single one-to-many relationship is present</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Situational loading</h2>
					<p>In plain SQL, just write a different query, but that's not reusable.</p>
					<p>Some ORMs allow you to specify loading situationally.</p>
					<p>In JPA, use Entity Graphs.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Beware of Stamp Coupling</h2>
					<p>Overspecified entities with constraints the code isn't using.</p>
					<p>Only specify the fields you're actually using in your code.</p>
					<p>If you don't do that, somebody can change somethign that breaks, and <em>you aren't even using it!</em></p>
